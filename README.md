##For better designs, material-ui and react bootstrap has been used in the program.

This is my first time using react  and being able to create a front-end of an website within a short period of time is one of the top benefit of react. One of the other benefits is that react allows to create components which can be nested and reused on several webpages. This helped me to write shorter and structred code, which consumed less of my time. 

However, the  dependence of react on additional liberaires makes it complicated to use. For eg: I used additional libraries such as material-ui and react-bootstrap to design different components on the website . The documentations of materials-ui was confusing when I wanted to customise the components.  resulting onto complications. Therefore, it creates complication while depending on multiple libraries.
